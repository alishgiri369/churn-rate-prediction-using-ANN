# Customer Churn Prediction Using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

## Project Overview  
This repository demonstrates how to predict customer churn using an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**. The project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations, and the implementation of an ANN for churn prediction.  

## Features  
- **Data Cleaning**:  
  - Handled missing values and outliers.  
  - Encoded categorical variables and scaled features for optimal ANN performance.  

- **Data Visualization**:  
  - Used visualizations like heatmaps, bar plots, and histograms to understand feature relationships.  
  - Analyzed churn trends and feature distributions to guide model development.  

- **ANN Implementation**:  
  - Built a multi-layer neural network using TensorFlow/Keras.  
  - Optimized the model with hyperparameter tuning to improve accuracy and prevent overfitting.  

- **Performance Evaluation**:  
  - Evaluated the ANN with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
  - Visualized performance with a confusion matrix.  

## Tools and Libraries  
- **Python Libraries**: `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`  
- **Deep Learning Framework**: `TensorFlow`/`Keras`  
- **Visualization Tools**: `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`  



## Results  
- **Data Insights**: Visualized feature importance and patterns influencing churn.  
- **ANN Model**: Achieved high accuracy with effective hyperparameter tuning.  

## Conclusion  
This project demonstrates the use of ANN for predicting customer churn and highlights the importance of data preprocessing and visualization in model development.
